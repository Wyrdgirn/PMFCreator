PMF Creator by Wyrdgirn

Mod based on the original source code of piccahoe's PMF Creater v0.2. (http://piccahoe.phase1media.com)

Features:
    - Faster. I have altered the functions responsible for processing the file to speed up the creation of the final file using an optional memory buffer ("buff size" option).
    - Added microseconds option (Optional. You can leave it at 0).
    
Compile:

How to use:
    - Select your MPS video in "Path of your MPS"
    - Select the output file name in "Save As"
    - Set the duration time in the "M", "S" (and optionally in "Ms") boxes. For icons, check the "Make Icon" option.
    - (optional) Sets the memory buffer size in "buff size" and press the "bytes" button to switch between Bytes, Kilobytes (KB), Kibibytes (KiB), Megabytes (MB) and Mebibytes (MiB). (useful for large files or slow storage)
    - Press "Convert"
