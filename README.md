# PMF Creator by ***Wyrdgirn***

Mod based on the original source code of ***piccahoe's PMF Creater v0.2***. (http://piccahoe.phase1media.com)

***Features:***
- Faster. I have altered the functions responsible for processing the file to speed up the creation of the final file using an optional memory buffer ("buff size" option).
- Added microseconds option (Optional. You can leave it at 0).
    
***Compile:***
- Just `git clone` the repository and do `make` in the project dir...

***How to use:***
- Select your MPS video in `Path of your MPS`
- Select the output file name in `Save As`
- Set the duration time in the `M`, `S` (and optionally in `Ms`) boxes. For icons, check `Make Icon` too.
- (optional) Sets the memory buffer size in `buff size` and press the `bytes` button to set if the **buff size** are in Bytes, Kilobytes (KB), Kibibytes (KiB), Megabytes (MB) or Mebibytes (MiB). This option is useful for large files and slow storages only.
- Press `Convert`
